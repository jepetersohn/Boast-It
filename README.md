# Boast-It

Have a collection you'd like to show off?
Do you want to make us jealous by posting pictures of your artwork?
Have you visited all 50 states?

Whatever your accomplishment, "Boast It" by posting it. 

## Description

This is a solo project I created which closely mimics the functionality of Pinterest. I'm an avid reader, and I wanted a visual way to keep track of the books I read. Users can create accounts, log in/out, and publish categorized boards full of posts.

## Technologies used:
* Ruby on Rails
* sqlite3
* SASS
* Devise
* Paperclip
* HAML



NOTE: Waiting for patch to be released which will fix error resulting from Rails version updates which combined Bignum/Fixnum into Integer.
